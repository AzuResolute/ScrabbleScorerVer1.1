# ScrabbleScorer

ScrabbleScorer is a console application made using C# and a nuget package called OpenOfficeXml.
This project logs scrabble scores for 2-6 players.

Created in October 2018, one month after beginning my programming journey.

## Features

At start up, the user is asked how many players are playing.
